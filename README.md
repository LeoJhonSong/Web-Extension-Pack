# Web Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions I use when developing **Web** applications. I
would be glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! üëç

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è before installation I suggest you read lines with ‚ö†Ô∏è tags first, where some requirements are mentioned.

## My tricks

Here are some tricks!üòÑ

VSCode sometimes stucks when too many extensions are installed? Here are two
tricks:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select **Developer: Open
   Process Explorer** to see which extensions cost most. Then disable (just
   workspace) some extensions you don't need in current workspace.
2. thinks disable extensions one by one too annoying? you can disable a group
   of extensions by simply disable **a extension pack**! ‚úåÔ∏è Another good news is
   that you can uninstall any extension included in the pack while this extension
   pack is still thereüéä
3. want to make your own extension pack? [This](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/03/07/extension-pack-roundup)
   may helps youüëç

## This pack includes

- [Browser Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auchenberg.vscode-browser-preview) A real browser preview inside your
  editor that you can debug

- [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) Beautify javascript, JSON, CSS, Sass, and HTML in Visual Studio Code.
- [Remote Workspace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkloubert.vscode-remote-workspace)
  allow editing remote workspace just
  like local ones.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è you have to do the keybindings by yourself
- HTML/CSS
  - [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)
  - [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

- Javascript
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- Stylus
  - [language-stylus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sysoev.language-stylus)
    Stylus language support.
- [Django](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=batisteo.vscode-django) provides common snippets and django template language support
- Color
  - [Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight)
  - [Color Picker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anseki.vscode-color)

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Color Picker requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (including NPM) installed and available in your `$PATH` and you need to install some npm
    modules **before first launch**. I suggest do this [the manual way](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anseki.vscode-color#user-content-manual-installation-npm-modules)
    as you can see clearly whether the installation is finished.

    ‚ùå After installation I met a issue that [the palette is invisible](https://github.com/anseki/vscode-color/issues/78), it can be easily fixed by setting
    `coloHelper.disableGpu` to **1**.
- SVG
  - [SVG](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg) SVG
    language support.
  - [SVG Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=henoc.svgeditor)

    ‚ö†Ô∏è please notice that the **language support** is needed or there will be
    [something wrong](https://github.com/henoc/svgeditor/issues/43)
  - [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv)
